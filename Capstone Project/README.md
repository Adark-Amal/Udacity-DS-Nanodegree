# Customer Churn Prediction

## Overview
This project focuses on predicting customer churn for a fictional music streaming company called Sparkify. The goal is to develop a predictive model that can identify users likely to churn, enabling the business to take proactive measures to retain customers.

## Installation
To run this project, you'll need the following Python libraries installed:

- NumPy
- Pandas
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- PySpark SQL
- PySpark ML

## Project Goal
The primary goal behind this project is to address the challenge of customer churn within a music streaming service. The key project components include:

1. Loading and cleaning a small subset (128MB) of the full dataset (12GB).
2. Conducting Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to gain insights into the data and identify relevant features for predicting churn.
3. Feature Engineering to create meaningful features for modeling.
4. Building predictive models using various machine learning algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Gradient Boosted Trees, Linear SVM, and Naive Bayes.

## File Descriptions
The project consists of a jupyter notebook that contains all the code for performing the analysis
